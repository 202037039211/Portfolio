            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                I am a dynamic individual with a unique combination of technical expertise, business acumen, and a passion for continuous growth. Currently pursuing a BBA in Hospitality Management, I’ve chosen this path not only because of its relevance in a thriving global industry like Dubai but also for its ability to shape me into a well-rounded professional. Hospitality offers a comprehensive foundation in business, covering essential areas such as management, marketing, finance, and customer service. While my primary career focus is in technology, this degree complements my technical abilities, preparing me for future entrepreneurial endeavors where both business and tech intersect.

While I may not hold a formal degree in computer science, I’ve pursued self-learning rigorously through industry-leading courses, certifications, internships, and practical projects that surpass traditional academic offerings.
